This code is all from a template created (I think) by RogueException (I can't seem to find it any more so idk if there's a better way to do this now).

To Install:
- download DiscordDotNet.ProjectTemplate.zip to "Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates" (maybe be slightly different depending on version).
- download DiscordDotNet.ItemTemplate.zip to "Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ItemTemplates".
- run Visual Studio and create your project!
- configure config.json with your bot's token and your desired bot prefix.
